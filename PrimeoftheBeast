//What are all the prime numbers under 666?

//HELP ME: I have no idea how to compile or 
//run a program on github.

//No longer using an ArrayList. I'm gonna use 
//an array of size 666, and it's okay that it 
//won't be completely filled because it will 
//be a temp array. The real array will be made 
//after the loop with a size of the counter.

int[] temp = new int[666];
int[] primeNo;
int count = 1;

temp[0] = 2;

//this for loop only checks integers between 3 and 666
for(int i = 3; i < 666; i++) {
   boolean prime = 1;
   
   for (int j = i-1; j > 1; j--)
      if (i%j == 0)  //checks if an integer is 
            //divible by any number less than 
            //itself but more than 1
         prime = 0; //if it is divible by any 
            //other number, it is not a prime 
            //and is therefore false
   
   //We've now checked whether the given 
   //integer, i, is prime.
   
   if (prime) { 
      temp[count] = i;
      count++;
   }
}

primeNo = new int[count];

//fill primeNo with values in temp array
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
   primeNo[i] = temp[i];
//We now have an array, primeNo, filled with every 
//prime number between 1 and 666 with no nulls. One 
//is NOT a prime number. Our temp array is now 
//superfluous and can be overwritten and/or ignored.

//print primeNo array
//I don't know how to print on github, but I'll 
//try some things out.
